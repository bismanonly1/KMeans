For this project, we will use K-Means Clustering Project database from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/faressayah/k-means-clustering-private-vs-public-universities)
For this project we will attempt to use K-Means Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.
We actually have the labels for this data set, but we will NOT use them for the K-Means clustering algorithm, since that is an unsupervised learning algorithm.
As we will shortly see, we have a data frame with 777 observations on 18 variables.
